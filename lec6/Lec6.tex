This lecture covers disturbances in electircal circuits, such as common mode
current, Electro Magnetic Pulses and Electro Static Discharge. Distrurbances are
gathered under the name Electro Magnetic Interference, or \textit{EMI}, and the
amount of EMI a circuit generates is called Electro Magnetic Compatibility,
\textit{EMX}. A good EMC means low or no interference.
